**Project Description**:
This project aims to enhance the management and monitoring of schools by providing insights into academic performance at different levels. District administrators will be able to view overall school performance, while schools can track the performance of their classes, and teachers can monitor individual student progress. The system will track daily attendance, student marks, and subject-level performance, helping educators make informed decisions to improve learning outcomes. The project is currently under development and will provide a structured platform for managing classes, teachers, students, and their academic data.
